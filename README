DESCRIPTION
The f{char}, F, t and T family of motions are often more effective
than the more general l, w and W motions. However, there are situations
where they are difficult to apply.
Take a long file system path like /var/opt/foo/a/very/long/path/to/filename.
Imagine you are on the beginning / and want to change the entire directory
path, but keep the filename. You'd either have to count occurrences (e.g. c8f/
or c2tf), do multiple moves ($T/cB), use visual mode (veeeeeeeelc), or a
search (c/filen<CR>).

This plugin extends the built-in f/F/t/T motions with counterparts that move
to the last occurrence of {char} in the line. For the above example, that
would be a short c,f/ to jump to the last slash in the line.

USAGE
,f{char}                To [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting from the
                        end of the line. The cursor is placed on {char}.
,F{char}                To the [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting from
                        the beginning of the line. The cursor is placed on
                        {char}.
,t{char}                Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting
                        from the end of the line. The cursor is placed on the
                        character left of {char}.
,T{char}                Till after [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting
                        from the beginning of the line. The cursor is placed
                        on the character right of {char}.

                        All motions can be repeated with ; and ,. However,
                        the ,t and ,T motions will jump to, not until, the
                        next {char}.
