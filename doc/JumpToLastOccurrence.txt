DESCRIPTION				    *JumpToLastOccurrence-description*

The |f|{char}, |F|, |t| and |T| family of motions are often more effective
than the more general |l|, |w| and |W| motions. However, there are situations
where they are difficult to apply. 
Take a long file system path like /var/opt/foo/a/very/long/path/to/filename.
Imagine you are on the beginning / and want to change the entire directory
path, but keep the filename. You'd either have to count occurrences (e.g. c8f/
or c2tf), do multiple moves ($T/cB), use visual mode (veeeeeeeelc), or a
search (c/filen<CR>). 

This plugin extends the built-in f/F/t/T motions with counterparts that move
to the last occurrence of {char} in the line. For the above example, that
would be a short c,f/ to jump to the last slash in the line. 

==============================================================================
USAGE						  *JumpToLastOccurrence-usage*

,f{char}		To [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting from the
			end of the line. The cursor is placed on {char}
			|inclusive|.
,F{char}		To the [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting from
			the beginning of the line. The cursor is placed on
			{char} |exclusive|.
,t{char}		Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting
			from the end of the line. The cursor is placed on the
			character left of {char} |inclusive|.
,T{char}		Till after [count]'th occurrence of {char}, counting
			from the beginning of the line. The cursor is placed
			on the character right of {char} |exclusive|.

			All motions can be repeated with |;| and |,|. However,
			the ,t and ,T motions will jump to, not until, the
			next {char}.

INSTALLATION				   *JumpToLastOccurrence-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim JumpToLastOccurrence.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES				   *JumpToLastOccurrence-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				  *JumpToLastOccurrence-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|: 

					       *g:JumpToLastOccurrence_Leader*
By default, all mappings start with |,| (comma) as the map leader instead of
using <Leader>. I personally find the default <Leader> key too far off the
keyboard to be useful for custom motions (which also cannot be repeated via
the |.| (dot) command, so they should be very fast to type repeatedly), but
quite suitable for general, less frequently used custom mappings. 
To avoid losing the (rarely used) |,| mapping (which repeats latest f, t, F or
T in opposite direction), you can remap it to ,,: >
    nnoremap ,, ,
    xnoremap ,, ,
    onoremap ,, ,

If you don't agree with this and want all motions to start with <Leader> (or
any other key), you can do this (before sourcing this script): >
    let g:JumpToLastOccurrence_Leader = '<Leader>'

If you want to use completely different or only a few of the mappings, map
your keys to the <Plug>JumpToLastOccurrence_? mapping targets _before_
sourcing this script (e.g. in your |vimrc|). 

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS				    *JumpToLastOccurrence-limitations*

- The ,t and ,T motions will jump to, not until, the next {char}. There's no
  built-in Vim motion for that reverse movement, and overloading ; and , would
  be very complex and probably also necessitate overloading f/F/t/T. 
- When there's no match, the operator-pending mappings aren't canceled. So,
  cfX does not go into insert mode when there's no "X" match, but c,fX does. 
- The operator-pending mode mappings don't work properly when the char at the
  end of the buffer is matched; the final character will remain, and a beep is
  issued. But one would probably use the much simpler $ motion in that case,
  anyway. 

KNOWN PROBLEMS				 *JumpToLastOccurrence-known-problems*
